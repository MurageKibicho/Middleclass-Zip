## Disclaimer
Data compression is a solved problem. No ✨ magical algorithm ✨ exists to make files infinitely small. Also, you can't compress random data.

## Target audience
You've got a mid to high-end phone or laptop and you're stuggling with slow internet. We make internet files smaller by performing intensive computations on your device. 

## Inspiration
I struggled with 3G internet connections while travelling through the Middle East and Africa. 
Furthermore, internet outside the United States is wildy expensive. For instance, while I was in Kenya, I was charged 10 dollars for 1 GB (ISPs in these countries sell internet packets in small 10MB bundle sizes) 
I was super frustrated to learn that my favorite drawing software used GZIP and not better compression algos.


Honestly, I'd rather have my phone perform extra 
computations than 
There's a tradeoff between smaller file sizes and intensive computation.

## Background Story
 I paid the most while travelling through the Middle East and Africa. 
I was frustrated to discover internet packets were compressed with GZIP and not better methods. It was difficult to convince the devs to package their packets better.

\
I blew a fuse when Guido Rosso from the Rive team told me that they send uncompressed packets to "support low-end devices".

I've got a 1000$ iPhone and a 2000$ mac.
