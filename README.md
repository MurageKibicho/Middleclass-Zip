# Middleclass Zip
## Faster, cheaper internet for the middle class

### Disclaimer
Data compression is a solved problem. No ✨ magical algorithm ✨ exists to make files infinitely small. Also, you can't compress random data.

### How It Works
We make internet files smaller by performing intensive computations on your device. 
\
Small files are cheaper to send and travel fast on slow networks.

## Target audience
- You've got a mid to high-end phone or laptop.
- You're stuggling with unbearably slow internet. 
- Your internet service provider(ISP) charges you exorbitant rates per megabyte.
- You wouldn't mind performing intensive, battery-consuming calculations on your phone. 


## Inspiration
Outside the United States, internet is slow and wildy expensive. For instance, while I was in Kenya, I was charged 10 dollars for 1 GB (ISPs in these countries sell internet packets in small 10MB bundle sizes) 
Every kilobyte counts!

It was frustrating to learn that my favorite drawing software used GZIP and not better algos.
Upon enquiry, the devs attributed their compression choice to *"Support for low-end devices that can't handle lots of computations"*.

\
I found concerning their desire for "inclusivity" superceded my need for faster internet. It gave vibes analogous to California's '*"Let's not teach algebra in public schools because math is elitist"*

Indeed, there's a tradeoff between smaller file sizes and intensive computation. 
Honestly, I'd rather have my 1000$ Iphone perform extra computations than wait an hour for my YouTube video to buffer in 360p.

I made this repo to see if other people were interested in making the internet better for user with mid to higher end devices.
