# Middleclass Zip
## Faster, cheaper internet for the middle class

### Disclaimer
Data compression is a solved problem. No ✨ magical algorithm ✨ makes files infinitely small. Also, you can't compress random data.

### How It Works
We make internet files smaller by performing intensive computations on your device.
\
Small files are cheaper to send and travel fast on slow networks.

## Target audience
- You've got a mid to high-end phone or laptop.
- You're stuggling with unbearably slow internet. 
- Your internet service provider(ISP) charges you exorbitant rates per megabyte.
- You're fine performing intensive, battery-consuming calculations on your device. 


## Inspiration
Outside the United States, internet is slow and wildy expensive. For instance, I was charged 10 dollars for 1 GB while in Kenya. (Local ISPs sell small 10MB bundles to hide the true cost). So every kilobyte counts!


It was frustrating to use my favorite drawing software because the files were unbearably large. The authors chose to use Gzip and not better methods.
Upon enquiry, the devs attributed their compression choice to *"Support for low-end devices that can't handle lots of computations"*.

\
Their desire for "inclusivity" superceded my need for fast internet. It gave vibes analogous to California's *"Let's not teach algebra in public schools because math is elitist"*

There's a tradeoff between smaller file sizes and intensive computation. 
However, I'd rather have my 1000$ Iphone perform extra computations than wait an hour for my YouTube video to buffer in 360p.

I made this repo to gauge <ins>interest in making the internet faster for the middle class </ins>(users with mid to high-end devices).
