### Disclaimer
Data compression is a solved problem. No ✨ magical algorithm ✨ makes files infinitely small. Also, you can't compress random data.

### How It Works
We make internet files smaller by performing intensive computations on your device.
\
Small files are cheaper to send and travel fast on slow networks.

### Technical Overview
We find uncompressed data inside files then run the data through 7Zip. Further compression to come ✨


## Target audience
- You've got a mid to high-end phone or laptop.
- You're stuggling with unbearably slow internet. 
- Your internet service provider(ISP) charges you exorbitant rates per megabyte.
- You're fine performing intensive, battery-consuming calculations on your device. 


## Inspiration
Outside the United States, internet is slow and wildy expensive. For instance, I was charged 10 dollars for 1 GB while in Kenya. (Local ISPs sell small 10MB bundles to hide the true cost). So every kilobyte counts!


There's a tradeoff between smaller file sizes and intensive computation. 
However, I'd rather have my 2000$ Mac perform extra computations than wait an hour for my YouTube video to buffer in 360p.

I made this repo to gauge <ins>interest in making the internet faster for the middle class </ins>(users with mid to high-end devices).
