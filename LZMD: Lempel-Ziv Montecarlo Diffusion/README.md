## LZMD : Lempel-Ziv Montecarlo Diffusion

### Update:
I got rejected from YCombinator last week. I took a gap year at Yale to build this and I burnt through my savings.
Please reach out - murage@fileforma.com - if you want to angel/lead my pre-seed round. 
Here's my (pitch deck)[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jzcLHrZaQfi0oOKk9JtY_K_IfVrcVjTeQgZzMfiYNm4/edit]

### Disclaimer
Data compression is a solved problem. No ✨ magical algorithm ✨ makes files infinitely small. Also, you can't compress random data.

### How It Works
We built a custom diffusion model to simulate the weird change in volume when water and alcohol mix.

This is not a data compressor. It's a navier-stokes solver whose solutions lead to smaller file sizes.
